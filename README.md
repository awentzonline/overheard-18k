==================================================
18,000 normal conversations you might hear in normal places, as generated by Claude.

```
import datasets
datasets.load_dataset('awentzonline/overheard-18k')
```

If babies learn language by listening to people speak then maybe we need a dataset like that.
I'm making this as a potential dataset for use in the [BabyLM 2024 Challenge](https://babylm.github.io/)
where the object is to train language models with small datasets of 10 million or 100 million words.
This dataset has 3,360,107 words if you naively split it.

Each sample is a list of dialog lines alternating between speakers.

The dataset was generated as follows:
 * generate a list of common activities where people might talk to each other
 * for each activity, generate a list of potential conversation topics
 * go one deeper, for each topic suggest more specific aspects of the conversation
 * generate a "normal" conversation for each (activity, topic, subtopic) of approximately 200 words

The version I'm publishing was generated with `claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620`.
